    "text": "Introduction\nThe NIFTY 50 is a benchmark Indian stock market index that represents the weighted average of 50 of the largest Indian companies listed on the National Stock Exchange. It is one of the two main stock indices used in India, the other being the BSE SENSEX. It is owned and managed by NSE Indices (previously known as India Index Services & Products Limited), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the NSE Strategic Investment Corporation Limited. NSE Indices had a marketing and licensing agreement with Standard & Poor’s for co-branding equity indices until 2013. The Nifty 50 index was launched on 22 April 1996, and is one of the many stock indices of Nifty. The NIFTY 50 index has shaped up to be the largest single financial product in India, with an ecosystem consisting of exchange-traded funds (onshore and offshore), exchange-traded options at NSE, and futures and options abroad at the SGX. NIFTY 50 is the world’s most actively traded contract. WFE, IOM and FIA surveys endorse NSE’s leadership position.\nI want to analyse the stock trends over the past decade and wanted to see if this data would give me an idea about India’s economic development. I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle and will perform an EDA of the stock prices listed from 2000 to 2021. Some answers I wanted to find out were :\n\nD they all stocks remain the same in the NIFTY 50 index every year?\nWhat is the best and worst stock in a year?\nWhat is the stock performance of companies that I regularly invest in?\nWhich stock plummeted the most in 2008?\nWhat are the highest and lowest stock price ever observed?\n\n\nColumn Descriptions\nThe dataset has multiple columns which tells us about the stock prices, traded volumes and son.\nThe column descriptions are as follows:\n\nDate — Date of trade\nsymbol — Name of the company\nSeries — We have only one series - EQ, which stands for Equity.\nPrev Close — Refers to the final price of a stock of the previous dat when the market officially closes, which is at 3:30pm IST\nOpen — The open is the starting period of trading on a securities exchange or organized over-the-counter market.\nHigh — Highest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day.\nLow — Lowest price at which a stock traded during the course of the trading day.\nLast — The last price of a stock is just one price to consider when buying or selling shares. The last price is simply the most recent one\nClose — The close is a reference to the end of a trading session in the financial markets when the markets close for the day.\nVWAP (Volume-weighted average price)- It is the ratio of the value traded to total volume traded over a particular time horizon. It is a measure of the average price at which a stock is traded over the trading horizon\nVolume — It is the amount of a security that was traded during a given period of time\nTurnover -It is a measure of sellers versus buyers of a particular stock. It is calculated by dividing the daily volume of a stock by the “float” of a stock, which is the number of shares available for sale by the general trading public.\nTrades- The number of shares being traded on a given day is called trading volumes\nDeliverable Volume — quantity of shares which actually move from sellers to buyers\n%Deliverable — shares which are actually transferred from one person’s to another’s demat account."

This data from 2000 to 2021 is not consistent, i.e., there are 65 distinct entries found. Which suggests that some stocks under-performed and got replaced with new ones over time. Hence the aggregate of all stocks combined became 65\n\n\nCode\nall_stocks_yy %>% select(1) %>% distinct()\n\n\n# A tibble: 65 × 1\n   Symbol    \n   <chr>     \n 1 MUNDRAPORT\n 2 ADANIPORTS\n 3 ASIANPAINT\n 4 UTIBANK   \n 5 AXISBANK  \n 6 BAJAJ-AUTO\n 7 BAJAJFINSV\n 8 BAJAUTOFIN\n 9 BAJFINANCE\n10 BHARTI    \n# … with 55 more rows\n\n\n\n\nYear vs Volume of stock traded\nWe can infer from the mean of Volume column, the number of stocks sold each year kept increasing.\n\nThis can hint an increase in demat accounts and number of active trading as well.\nNew stocks must have entered the NIFTY50 index, and started performing well over the years\nSpecial attention can be paid to volumes of stock sold between 2018 - 2021. There is a sharp increase in the volume of shares traded. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many stocks fell which encouraged more people than ever to open a demat account and start investing( I opened mine during this time!!!)\n\n\n\nCode\nbarplot<- all_stocks_yy %>% \n  group_by(yy) %>% \n  select(`Volume`) %>% \n  summarise_all(mean, na.rm=TRUE)\n\nbarplot(height=barplot$Volume, names=barplot$yy, \n        col=\"#69b3a2\",\n        horiz=T, las=1,\n        xlab='Volume --->',\n        ylab='Year --->',\n        main='Year v/s Volume',\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking stock’s consistency in NIFTY50 index\nBy running the below code, I am checking whether a stock has maintained its consistency in the top 50 stocks. Looks like the stocks kept changing each year, and some stocks were not present in the list at all! The stocks not present in that year can be identified with 0 ( a metric for the sum of all shares sold in a year ). That is, if no shares are sold, then the stock wouldn’t make the list.\nSome observations that can be made here are:\n\nStocks like ADANIPORTS, NESTLEIND, NTPC, SSLT didn’t enter the stock market from 2000. Their companies began appearing further down the line, such as from 2010\nSome companies, though made it to the NIFTY 50 list, have dropped out over the years due to a massive dip in stock price due to various factors. Some such examples would be KOTAKMAH, INFOSYSTCH, TELCO, TISCO have experienced huge losses which can be explained change in their leadership, an acquisition gone wrong, or someone filed a case in the court.\nFrom my understanding so far, a stock price dips heavily due to change in public sentiment, as a direct impact of news channels.\n\n\n\nCode\nall_stocks_yy %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from=`yy`, values_from = `Volume`) %>% \n  group_by(Symbol) %>% select(Trades, 14:35) %>% \n  summarise_all(sum, na.rm=TRUE) %>% \n  relocate(`2000`:`2006`, .before = `2007`)\n\n\n# A tibble: 65 × 24\n   Symbol  Trades `2000` `2001` `2002` `2003` `2004` `2005` `2006` `2007` `2008`\n   <chr>    <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1 ADANIP… 1.08e8 0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0     \n 2 ASIANP… 1.02e8 3.55e6 4.45e6 3.99e6 6.10e6 7.93e6 8.78e6 7.61e6 9.96e6 8.48e6\n 3 AXISBA… 2.96e8 0      0      0      0      0      0      0      6.71e7 5.79e8\n 4 BAJAJ-… 6.75e7 0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      3.07e7\n 5 BAJAJF… 5.13e7 0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      5.30e7\n 6 BAJAUT… 0      6.06e5 2.69e5 1.06e6 2.68e6 3.60e6 4.07e6 2.32e6 3.96e6 6.42e6\n 7 BAJFIN… 1.39e8 0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0      0     \n 8 BHARTI  0      0      0      9.55e7 3.23e8 8.80e8 4.36e8 8.82e7 0      0     \n 9 BHARTI… 2.09e8 0      0      0      0      0      0      1.21e8 4.55e8 9.59e8\n10 BPCL    1.37e8 2.12e7 5.39e7 3.90e8 3.51e8 2.27e8 1.12e8 1.10e8 1.27e8 1.66e8\n# … with 55 more rows, and 13 more variables: `2009` <dbl>, `2010` <dbl>,\n#   `2011` <dbl>, `2012` <dbl>, `2013` <dbl>, `2014` <dbl>, `2015` <dbl>,\n#   `2016` <dbl>, `2017` <dbl>, `2018` <dbl>, `2019` <dbl>, `2020` <dbl>,\n#   `2021` <dbl>\n\n\n\n\nStocks which didn’t enter stock market for 10 yrs\nThere are 6 stocks which did not enter the stock market - ADANIPORTS, HEROMOTOCO, INFY,SSLT,UPL, VEDL. They were not publicly listed in to be traded, as the company was still small in size. A company enters stock market once it has captured enough market in an area, and wants to expand its operations and brand to a larger scale. The companies then offer IPO, where the shares are made available to common people to invest. Using this additional income, the companies expand their scale of operations to PAN_India!\n\n\nCode\nall_stocks_yy %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from=`yy`, values_from = `Volume`) %>% \n  group_by(Symbol) %>% select(Trades, 14:35) %>% \n  summarise_all(sum, na.rm=TRUE) %>% \n  relocate(`2000`:`2006`, .before = `2007`) %>% \n  select(`Symbol`, `2000`:`2010`) %>% \n  filter(across(`2000`:`2010`, ~ . ==0)) %>% \n  select(Symbol)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 1\n  Symbol    \n  <chr>     \n1 ADANIPORTS\n2 HEROMOTOCO\n3 INFY      \n4 SSLT      \n5 UPL       \n6 VEDL      \n\n\n\n\nBest and Worst Performing Stock of 2000\nZEETELE - Best performing stock in 2000, AJAUTOFIN - Worst performing stock 2000.

It was surprising to see such a sharp decline in traded volumes for ZEETELE just the corresponding year. And the worst performing stock of 2000 gradually gained traction and crossed the aforementioned stock in the year 2006.\nThe dip in stock volume is observed for BAJAUTOFIN due to the stock market crash, but still continues to maintain its position in the NIFTY index. Looks like ZEETELE got kicked of the NIFTY index at the beginning of 2007\nThis link describes about the US stock market crash after the attack on World Trade Center on Sept 11, 2001. The corresponding events led to stock crash world wide, thus effecting Indian markets as well. ZEETELE is one of those stock which got highly effected. In the following years, many stocks failed to make a come back and also got replaced by other stocks in the NIFTY index.\nRed line - BAJAUTOFIN , Blue Line - ZEETELE\n\n\nCode\np<-all_stocks_yy %>% \n  select(Symbol, yy, `Prev Close`) %>% \n  filter(Symbol == \"ZEETELE\" | Symbol == \"BAJAUTOFIN\") %>% \n  group_by(yy, Symbol) %>% \n  summarize_all(mean, na.rm = TRUE) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Symbol, values_from = `Prev Close`) %>% \n  ggplot()+\n  geom_line(aes(x=yy, y=BAJAUTOFIN), color='red') + \n  geom_point(aes(x=yy, y=BAJAUTOFIN),size=1.5, color='red') + \n  geom_line(aes(x=yy, y=ZEETELE), color='blue') + \n  geom_point(aes(x=yy, y=ZEETELE),size=1.5, color=\"blue\") +   \n  labs(title='ZEETELE, BAJAUTOFIN - Stock performance', x=\"Year\", y=\"Previous Close\") + theme_bw() \n\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest and Worst stock of 2021 by Volume\nBest performing stock was TATAMOTORS, and the worst performing stock was SHREECEM\n\n\nCode\n# best performing stock of 2021\nall_stocks_yy %>% \n  group_by(yy, Symbol) %>% \n  select(`Volume`) %>% \n  summarise_all(sum, na.rm=TRUE) %>% \n  arrange(desc(Volume)) %>% \n  filter(yy==2021) %>% \n  head()\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   yy [1]\n     yy Symbol         Volume\n  <dbl> <chr>           <dbl>\n1  2021 TATAMOTORS 7724352104\n2  2021 SBIN       4088703389\n3  2021 ITC        2982397228\n4  2021 ONGC       2501344432\n5  2021 NTPC       2132902536\n6  2021 IOC        2072409999\n\n\nCode\n# worst performing stock of 2021\nall_stocks_yy %>% \n  group_by(yy, Symbol) %>% \n  select(`Volume`) %>% \n  summarise_all(sum, na.rm=TRUE) %>% \n  arrange(Volume) %>% \n  filter(yy==2021) %>% \n  head()\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   yy [1]\n     yy Symbol       Volume\n  <dbl> <chr>         <dbl>\n1  2021 SHREECEM    5311556\n2  2021 NESTLEIND   9157164\n3  2021 BAJAJFINSV 48075888\n4  2021 BRITANNIA  54033577\n5  2021 ULTRACEMCO 56268478\n6  2021 BAJAJ-AUTO 68826756\n\n\n\nPlotting the above results\nOver the years, SHREECEM have observed a steady growth.

    "text": "Reflection\nThis project has been a great learning experience for me. It was interesting to see how many insights can be derived from a single data set. I felt that I barely scratched the surface of this goldmine dataset. I used to follow stock market trends for a while during the covid lockdown, which made me interested to try this do an EDA of this data-set. My current regret is, there are lot of amazing insights and visualizations that I could do, but I didn’t know how to manipulate multiple variables to make it happen.\nI faced challenges with almost every aspect of this project. I’ve been going back to my notes, stack overflow and a bunch of youtube videos to get clarity. I made use of really good websites and bookmarked some of the solutions for future reference. There is a lot of power in R and it made me realize I could really do a lot more with it.\nI’ve made use of other packages apart from the standard ones taught in the class, and tried resolving multiple errors by fine-tuning the functions. There is still a lot more to learn, and I will continue learning to be better at visualization."

    "text": "Conclusion\nI got some clarity on the highs and lows of the stock market. A stock doesn’t appear to be consistent in the NIFTY index and new ones get added or replaced each consecutive year. Sometimes the stocks start at a very high price, but plummets almost immediately the next year,which makes it very dangerous to have had shares in that stock(,i.e., ZEETELE). Some stocks stood the test of time and their brand image grew bigger. Not all stocks started out at year 2000, while some of them entered almost 10 years later and continued to be in the NIFTY index. While some stocks changed considerably due to world events such as terrorist attacks on WTC, Covid 19, Wall Street crash etc, not all stocks managed to recover.\nA stock’ss performance is directly proportional to its public image. The stock price immediately drops if the company’s image is tarnished. The number of people who started investing grew each year, and the highest jump in the traded volumes can be observed between 2018 to 2021, a direct consequence of COVID-19 pandemic. Since people were restricted at home, there was a lot of surplus money sitting idly in their bank accounts. Therefore they invested in the stock markets which were crashing due to the declining businesses. All the NIFTY stocks will rise each time they fall, is what I’ve observed, but stocks from the manufacturing industry will only experience temporary dips in price.\nAs India is a developing country, there is a continuous involvement of the manufacturing industry. So even if there is a plateau in price, the price and public sentiment will eventually rise."

This document serves as a reference to common Git commands. I keep forgetting them constantly

## For first time setup only

Run the below lines in the terminal only during the initial setup Here 'name' represents the github username and 'email' represents your github email

\$ git config --global user.name "\[name\]"\
\$ git config --global user.email "\[email address\]"

This command sets the author name and email address respectively to be used with your commits.

## For regular workflows

All the commands are self explanatory

\$ git init \[repository name\] <br> This command is used to start a new repository.

\$ git clone \[url\] <br> Example : git clone https://github.com/Adithya1243/googleDataAnalytics_capstone.git <br> This command is used to obtain a repository from an existing URL.

\$ git add \* <br> This command adds one or more to the staging area.<br>

\$ git commit -m "\[ Type in the commit message\]"<br> This command records or snapshots the file permanently in the version history.

\$ git status<br> This command lists all the files that have to be committed.<br>

\$ git branch<br> This command lists all the local branches in the current repository.

\$ git push \[variable name\] \[branch\]<br>

Example : git push origin default<br> origin -\> URL of git repo -- https://github.com/Adithya1243/googleDataAnalytics_capstone.git<br> default -\> is the branch name<br> This command sends the branch commits to your remote repository.<br>

## Rare commands

Used little less frequently.

\$ git commit -a<br> This command commits any files you've added with the git add command and also commits any files you've changed since then.<br>

\$ git rm \[file\]<br> This command deletes the file from your working directory and stages the deletion.<br>

\$ git log\
This command is used to list the version history for the current branch.

\$ git branch -d \[branch name\]\
This command deletes the branch in github website.

\$ git checkout \[branch name\]\
This command is used to switch from one branch to another.

\$ git merge \[branch name\]\
This command merges the specified branch's history into the current branch.

## Special Errors
